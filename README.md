## 📦 What is CI?

**CI (Creative Identity)** is where we publish brand-approved artwork for the Little Samo Inc. organisation.  
Use the files here in your READMEs, blog posts, slide decks, or anywhere you need to show off the Little Samo brand.

*   Logos for **Little Samo** _(company)_ and **SamoAI** _(framework)_
*   Character renders & animations for **Samo** and **Nyx** — with more friends to come
*   Screenshots & short demo clips that illustrate our products

All assets live under version control and are delivered through **Git LFS** so your clones stay light-weight.
